## Beginnings in Healthcare

Healthcare and cafes have much more in common than you might think. Their similarities have served Rich Menendez, CEO and Founder of [Workshop Cafe](http://www.workshopcafe.com/), well in his quest to bring technology together with brick and mortar for the second time. 

Rich’s path is one that you may not have guessed would have led to owning a cafe that created its own category. He started off his career in electrical engineering and went on to get his MBA at Stanford Business School. While finishing up his degree, his classmate and longtime friend, Tom Lee (who also happens to be a doctor), got him on board with his plan to revolutionize health care. 

They started with one practice by the name of [One Medical](http://www.onemedical.com/), as they aimed to carve out a middle ground in the previously two-tiered medical system. There was concierge-like healthcare for the elite that came at a high cost. And then there was commodity health care for everyone else. Both of them only focused on transactions, and that’s what One Medical wanted to put an end to.

One Medical grew tremendously with time and funding and Rich was there every step of the way running operations. His experience got him thinking about the solution to a problem he had started to notice when he worked from coffee shops. He saw articles about “laptop squatters,” that looked down on him and others who just wanted to work in a different environment, with a good cup of coffee. He felt bad about sitting for hours on end working, but he told us, “I don’t want to drink five lattes and eat five muffins.” 

It seemed like a lose-lose situation for customers and businesses, but his hypothetical solution actually had some merit. While he sat at coffee shops for hours taking up space, he would have been happy to pay to sit there, but “the business doesn’t have a tin can at the door that says ‘drop a couple bucks in and absolve your sin of sitting here.’ But if they did, I’d do it.” Now Rich was onto something. 

## Don’t Make Customers Pay for Things They Don’t Want 

When it comes to cafes, there are at least two types of customers: the ones that want to get a coffee and get on with their day and those that want to work from the cafe as they sip their coffee. Rich is a firm believer that you shouldn’t have to pay for something you don’t want, but that’s exactly what happens in the typical cafe model. Instead, in Rich’s vision for a cafe, each group would pay for exactly what they want: a spot to work or a coffee (or both!). 

## Figure Out What Doesn’t Work and Fix it

Rich’s idea turned into Workshop Cafe, which put together the idea of having a cafe, but also work stations that customers could pay for by the hour. Once the cafe opened up, he learned that his customer base was not who he expected. 

“We thought this was going to be all about freelancers and super tiny companies, but the number of people who actually work for a big company just down the street is very high. They’re just getting out of the office.” The price point allows people to use it as an escape when they need it to get out of the office for a few hours and really focus on what they need to get done. 

Work as we know it is changing, as companies of all sizes adopt open office floor plans, but they don’t always work out so well. There can be distractions galore when what you need most is some alone time to think about how to best tackle what you’re working on. Workshop Cafe took on this problem by making an environment where you can work freely without anyone questioning how you’re getting your work done or how many cups of coffee you have or haven’t had that day. 

## Capitalize on What Customers Like Most About Your Business

When customers come to Workshop Cafe to work, they have a sense of ownership that Rich couldn’t have predicted. He sat in on a number of customer interviews and was surprised to hear that customers really liked the branded stickers with table numbers present on every table in the work area. Through talking to customers, Rich learned that the sticker helped make the table feel like it was theirs for the time they had reserved it on the Workshop app. They liked the symbolism of it, as they were saying “this is *my* spot” when they booked a table and sat down to work. 

Since he heard customers’ sense of satisfaction about those simple stickers, he decided to take it to the next level and test out hardware. Soon when customers book a table, a light will turn from green to red to indicate that it’s been reserved. Rich was able to figure out what his customers liked about his business and build on it to make them happier and more likely to spread the word about the new way to cowork. 

## Keep Commitment Low and Loyalty High

We asked Rich about how he sees Workshop Cafe in comparison to other coworking spaces, like WeWork. He told us that he’s creating a cafe that is a middle ground for laptop workers. On one side you have a crowded cafe, not designed for the laptop crowd. And on the other there’s WeWork and coworking spaces that require you to apply, sign a lease, and make a commitment.

Neither of these are ideal for someone who just wants to change up their work environment every once in awhile. Customers keep coming back to Workshop for hours on end because it was designed to give them the space and comfort to get things done. 

## Provide an Experience No Other Business Can

Rich has been connected to the Bay Area coffee business for years, which helped him as he chose what to serve at Workshop Cafe. He is an investor in [Blossom Coffee](http://www.blossomcoffee.com/), so he asked their President for the best coffee in the area. That led him to [Stanza Coffee](https://www.yelp.com/biz/stanza-coffee-san-francisco)’s young founder, Aaron Caddel, who recommended the famed [Stumptown](https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/). 

The partnership between Rich and Aaron continued, as Aaron helped set up and train all of Rich’s baristas. Aaron later came up with the idea for a bakery, and the success of the finished product, [Mr. Holmes Bakehouse](http://mrholmesbakehouse.com/), can’t be understated. Keeping up with the tradition of working together, Rich is on the board of the bakery and Workshop is the only coffee shop to sell their baked goods. Definitely a smart move because Mr. Holmes has developed a cult following and often sells out early in the day. 

## Wait to Grow, So You Can Do it Right

Beyond the partnerships that have helped Workshop gain notoriety, Rich has had great staff, both in his cafe and behind the scenes coding away to improve the app. There’s more going on at Workshop Cafe than meets the eye and they’ve gotten to the point where it’s viable to scale. 

Rich expanded on the timing, “it’s probably my engineering background that has had me wanting to not scale early because there’s so much going on here. There’s so much going on behind the scenes in terms of software and process and vibe and design of the store. We’ve iterated a lot of it, but now it’s ready. The units of economics are there.”

First will come more shops in San Francisco and he’s got his eyes set on national and international expansion when the time is right. Until then, you can pay Workshop Cafe a visit at 180 Montgomery Street in San Francisco.
