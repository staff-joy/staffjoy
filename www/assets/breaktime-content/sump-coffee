How many people do you know who have traded in a law career for a quirky coffee shop? My guess is not many. But that’s the story of Scott Carey, owner and roaster at [Sump Coffee](http://www.sumpcoffee.com/). We interviewed Scott last month and here is what we learned about his past with specialty coffee. 

A love of coffee developed slowly when Scott moved to New York’s Alphabet City in the mid 2000s. His timing was perfect because the speciality coffee scene was just taking off and he fell into the scene without trying to. [9th Street Espresso](http://www.ninthstreetespresso.com/) really started off his obsession with it’s no-frills vibe. He was already a fan of coffee, but his favorite shop made quality and artistry the standard. 


A few years later when he moved back to St. Louis to be with his family, he looked for the excellent coffee that anchored him in New York. But he couldn’t find it because no coffee shops had caught on to the specialty coffee wave just yet. It seemed like a market failure to him. So he decided to open a coffee shop and build something authentic from the ground up. 


Scott’s explained his philosophy, “Everyone already drinks coffee and if you open a speciality coffee shop, you’re not creating new consumers, you’re changing those consumers’ habits.” His challenge was twofold: getting St. Louis residents to try his specialty coffee and getting them to come back. His tactic was to create an experience and a product that no one else could recreate. 


## Brand Differentiation Using the Halo Effect

The tool he chose to differentiate his business was the [Slayer espresso machine](http://slayerespresso.com/). Sump was the only shop in Missouri to have a Slayer for several years. It allowed for free creativity that helped their shop stand out and attract customers with a specialty coffee experience that they couldn’t find anywhere else in the area. 


He cited his initial success as an example of the halo effect. The glow around the exclusivity of the Slayer helped build up their local recognition when they were first starting out.


## Small Businesses Don’t Need to Do it All

One thing that Scott was sure of from the beginning was that he didn’t want his shop to be a jack of all trades, master of none. Having the Slayer was the first step to making unforgettable coffee, but that’s not all that customers expect from a specialty coffee shop. Having a pastry with coffee is one of life’s simple pleasures, but not everyone can make the perfectly flakey croissant. So Scott leaves it up to the baking experts instead. 


He believes firmly in furthering Sump’s coffee expertise while collaborating with other companies that have different strengths. Tapping [Comet](http://cometcoffeestl.com/) for their well-revered baked goods was a smart move because he didn’t have to start from scratch. The lesson here is: focus on your area of expertise and build up your brand by partnering with similarly high caliber businesses that can fill in the gaps. 


## What Small Businesses Don’t Tell You

There are tasks that all small businesses have to take care of, like taking out the trash, and cleaning toilets, that no one is excited about. These nuts and bolts aren’t a part of the entrepreneur fantasy, but while some aspects require business owners to roll up their sleeves, others can be solved with technology. For example, Sump was one of the first users of [Square](https://squareup.com) in St. Louis. What’s more, Square CEO Jack Dorsey’s parents took a liking to Sump’s specialty coffee before they moved to the west coast. Square works well because of its simplicity and has the rare added bonus of inspiring Sump tweets from one of the biggest names in tech from time to time. 


## Learn Who Your Customers Are and Give Them What They Want

Another thing that small businesses learn over time is that their customer base may differ significantly from who they expected. Scott told us, “When you open a business, you fantasize who your clients are, but once you open, anyone can come in that door. You have to adjust to who your clients really are.” It’s a matter of rolling with the punches and adapting based on your true customer demographics and what they like. 


Scott told us a great story about a conversation he had with a chef from a famous San Francisco restaurant that impacted his take on specialty coffee. He asked the chef if he would make a well done steak, and much to Scott’s surprise he said he’d run over it with a car if a customer asked him to. While that’s a somewhat controversial stance, it does distill the reality of working in the hospitality industry. While a customer may ask for something that goes against industry best practices, it’s about how you respond to their request. The chef Scott spoke with explained that he’d put care into the steak and broil it, or find some other way to still provide an excellent culinary experience. 


The moral of the story here is that nothing happens the way you expect it do when it comes to starting or building up a restaurant. Your customers may be from a different demographic or ask for things you didn’t anticipate, that’s why being flexible is the best strategy you can put in place as a new business owner.


## What’s Next For Sump

Sump is lucky to have learned to be flexible early on because now that they’re expanding to a specialty coffee [shop in Nashville](http://www.sumpcoffee.com/blogs/news/were-expanding-south) early next year, they’re playing in a whole different ball game. The lease is signed, the work permits have been filed, much of the original design has been changed, and there’s still a lot more to do before the doors can open. Scott is sure they will cater to a different demographic in Nashville, so they’ll have to be adaptable in product and in experience. Good thing they’ve already got a head start on the flexible mentality.
