## How Kaldi’s Coffee Went from a Single Shop to 15 with a Farm in Hawaii

Welcome to Breaktime! Here at Staffjoy we’ve started this blog to empower small businesses owners with actionable tips from leaders in their community. 


For our inaugural episode we took it back to where it all began. Kaldi’s Coffee was the place where Staffjoy's, Philip Thomas, worked  on scheduling algorithms while studying at Washington University in St. Louis. Those algorithms turned into Staffjoy years later, to give small businesses a  scheduling communication tool.


Back in St. Louis to judge a hackathon, Philip had the chance to catch up with Tyler Zimmer, the owner of Kaldi’s Coffee, to learn what helped them grow from one coffee shop to 15 shops across the country, as well as their own coffee farm in Hawaii. Here’s what he learned and how you can apply them to your own business. 


## Humble Beginnings

The first Kaldi’s Coffee opened in St. Louis in 1994. The following year they started roasting their own coffee. And from there, the natural next step was selling coffee on the wholesale level, as well as opening more coffee shops. But Kaldi’s Coffee didn’t actually belong to the Zimmer family until a decade later. 


The Zimmer family had always been believers in Kaldi’s Coffee. They actually planned to open their own cafe and sell Kaldi’s brand coffee, but they decided opening a Kaldi’s was a better option. In 2005, they partnered with the original owners and two years later they bought the rest of the company.


Fast forward to today and there are 15 Kaldi’s coffee shops with three more opening in the next three months. Not to mention they own Latteland, have partnered with Honolulu Coffee to open coffee shops on three different Hawaiian islands, and have a 75 acre coffee farm in Kona! How did Kaldi’s Coffee achieve so much success? 


## A Day in the Life

Having a successful coffee chain obviously means having amazing coffee. And in order to do that, Tyler drinks a lot of coffee. We’re talking about 6 cups a day sometimes, since he has multiple tastings or “cuppings” a day. Tyler explained, “That’s the heart of our business, so we take it very seriously.” 


## How the Kaldi’s Team Contributes

Beyond their superb coffee, there are two things that Tyler cited: people and culture. He made a solid point about customers, “You can have a great cup of coffee, but if they’re not treated right, they’re not going to come back.” The experience that customers have in Kaldi’s coffee shops dictates how likely they are to return. Tyler’s daily cuppings make sure the coffee they serve is always top notch, and focusing simultaneously on hiring and retaining employees that really fit in with their values is the other part of the equation. After all, “People who want to start their day with a friendly face,” so Tyler makes sure that his employees always provide a warm atmosphere.  


Starbucks is often cited as creating a standard coffee culture around the globe. They really paved the way and since then smaller coffee shops have become popular, especially among millennials who focus on unique experiences. Tyler finds that they’re more educated about coffee and that helps his cause to sell high quality coffee, among other products. 


## How Tech Fits in

Tyler finds that in his business he’s used more technology in the past three to four years than ever before. And it has certainly paid off. Like many businesses, he uses Salesforce for customer service, but his stack goes much further than that. 


He uses a number of tools to help optimize manufacturing, inventory tracking, and sharing training information. But one in particular takes the cake: Cropster. This transparency software allows Kaldi’s to track roast profiles and refer back to all of their cupping data. Later they can reevaluate coffees they liked and would consider serving. Unlike several years ago, farms have also jumped on this technology and the shared data helps them improve their beans to help them get chosen next time. Tyler described it as, “Changing communication at the farm level.” 


## Local with a Global Flavor

The farms Kaldi’s is sharing their data with are all over the world and lucky Tyler gets to go on three to four trips a year to source the best coffee. This year he’s been able to go to Brazil, El Salvador, and Myanmar. The latter was especially moving because the country has been closed to trade for decades until just recently. 


Tyler was invited by the Coffee Quality Institute to taste and score coffee in Myanmar. He jumped at the opportunity because he has three refugees from Myanmar working at Kaldi’s and has learned from them about their culture. Due to his personal connection, visiting and trying out their coffee was a dream. While coffee has grown there since the 1800s, according to a USAID project, it previously wasn’t quite up to par as of last year. But this year Tyler tasted cups from numerous farms and many scored over 84, which is quite good. Needless to say, he bought from two villages and one farm this year and was able to bring a new experience to his customers. 


## Looking To the Future

Kaldi’s is certainly on the path for achieving steady growth in the coming years. While it’s a family-owned business based in St. Louis, they are very open to opportunity in other parts of the country. Tyler explained that expansion will focus on new ideas and markets to keep Kaldi’s fresh. 


One thing that will stay true as they expand is their focus on the customer experience. At their core is good coffee, but continuing to evolve means trying new things out. Whether that’s brewing tea, selling [cozy hats](http://kaldiscoffee.com/collections/apparel/products/poofball-beanie), or trying out different rewards programs, they’ve set themselves up for success with an adaptable and friendly approach.
